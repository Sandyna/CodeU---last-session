Exercise 3
Questions:
Does it mean that ugly number can't have any other prime factors than 2, 3 and 5? Is 14 not an ugly number?
Thoughts on the problem: 
We need to find a way, how to produce ugly numbers in order (depending on how big they are). Perhaps we could try finding a
pattern. Or we need to find a way how to tell wheter a number is ugly or not and how many ugly numbers are lesser than it.
We can generate ugly numbers by multiplying 2, 3 and 5 amnog themselves. The only remaining question is, in which order. 
It seems there is no pattern. 
It might be better to approach it from the other side - I can tell about a number whether it is ugly or not, by dividing it
by 5, 3, and 2. I can go through numbers up to 2^k (there might be a better estimate, but I currently don't know what it is) 
and see which ones of them are ugly.
