Exercise 3
Questions:
Does it mean that ugly number can't have any other prime factors than 2, 3 and 5? Is 14 not an ugly number?
Thoughts on the problem: 
We need to find a way, how to produce ugly numbers in order (depending on how big they are). Perhaps we could try finding a
pattern. Or we need to find a way how to tell wheter a number is ugly or not and how many ugly numbers are lesser than it.
First obvious approach would consist of calculating 
2, 3, 2*2, 5, 2*3, 2*2*2, 3*3, 2*5, 2*2*3, 2*2*2*2, 2*3*3, 3*3*3
